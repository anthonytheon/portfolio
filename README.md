# EasyComp
EasyComp is a competition management website that helps you create, record and announce competitions digitally, and manage competition administration all in one place.

EasyComp is a Fullstack Web Application for managing Ciputra University's Competitions. EasyComp was made with Laravel and Tailwind CSS. EasyComp is my final project that I made during my final semester in university.
